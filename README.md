# Hi, thanks for checking out my code challenge.

A quick note. I've tried to implement as many features as I could instead of reaching for libraries. I did this in order to demonstrate my knowledge of the underlying principles. I know that some of the patterns, like code-splitting, in a small app like this one are performance anti-patterns. Nevertheless I did it to show that I'm familiar with these concepts.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn test:types`

Uses tsd to do some basic type checking.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
